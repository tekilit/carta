<h3>Re: Eileen Dover university aplication</h3><br>

<p>Dear Eileen,<br></p>

<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome´s 
    science faculty to study as part of you PhD next year. 
    I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

<h4>Starting Dates</h4>

<p>We are happy to accomdate you starting your study with us at any time, 
    however it would suit us better if you couldstart at the beginning of a semester; 
    the start dates for each one are us follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
        <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
        <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so wich start date you would prefer.</p>

    <p>You can find more information about <ins>important university dates</ins> on our website.</p>

    <h4>Subjects of study</h4>

    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research 
        facility -- as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. 
        You seem like an intellegent dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we´d like to have on our team.
    Saying that,of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
        <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayer at temperatures exceeding 30ºC (86º F),
             when the audience sizes exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup> > 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
             <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, 
        including how long you´d expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think
    we´d need to know? Thanks.</p>

    <h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,
        my favourite dancers are as follows, with definitions:
    </p>

    <dl>
        <dt>Polynesian chiken dance</dt>
        <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influetial dance dating back as far as 300BC,
             a whole village would dance around in a circle like chikens, to encourage their livestock or be <q>friutful</q>.</dd>
        <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
        <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, wich involved huddling 
            close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling the bodies around in imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. 
            One of my follow students used to say that ge thoughts this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
        </dd>
        <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
        <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explores in the 1960s 
            belived to have discovered a new dance styke characterised by <q>robotic</q>, stilted movements, being practised by
            inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. later on however it was 
            discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold</dd>
            </dl>
